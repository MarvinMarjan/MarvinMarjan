### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Marvin and I'm 14 years old, i live in Amazonas, Brazil and i'm a programmer for hobby. I started programming when I was 11, I never thought I would like it so much. since then, I've been improving my skills, creating applications and projects. Currently, I use the C++ language, my favorite language, as a tool in this software development world. I create some softwares for hobby, but i would also like to make programming a professional job.
